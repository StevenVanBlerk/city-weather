# City Weather

## Introduction

This project was completed as part of a technical assessment. It is a simple weather app that displays the current weather of a provided city.

This project is using the metric system, meaning temperature readings are in Celsius.

This project makes use of tanstack's react-query to handle client side data fetching and handling. This supplies robust error and loading state handling without requiring the boilerplate of building it from scratch.
